# scripts

Collection of scripts, written in whatever language that compiles to binary,
that I use.

## Rationale

Basically I use a bunch of scripts that enhance bash. The problem comes from
bash which I don't know a lot of and always have to search how to do basic
things. Using languages that compile to an executable make it easy to install
and run, but allow me to be more expressive with my needs without having to
fight against the language.

Go and Deno are easy to work languages that compile to binary, heck, Deno makes
sure that their spec follows whatever Go does, so its almost a guarantee that
when theres a function on Go's std package, an equivalent exists in Deno's std
package.

Others may come, who knows...
